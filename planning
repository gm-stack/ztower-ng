The Code:
Primarily C++ - object orientation makes things simpler
 - but do we need that much flexibility? C is simpler and faster
 - where do we really need object orientation
SDL for base / graphics
Lua scripting for the buildings

Each Frame:
Paint background
Paint buildings
Check buildings in view for update

Each Building:
- what is your current status?
- what is your current texture?
- configure building
- "think" function sent to everything every 5 in-game "minutes"

Transport:
- probably need to hardcode types
- elevators
	- scheduling algorithm

People:
- simulate at a person level
- pathfinding
  - figure out where i need to go, replace orders in queue with "go to"
  - call "goto" function which figures out how long it takes, then calls think() after that
- they know what they have to do - try to complete jobs
- expected times - sometimes realistic, sometimes not
- created every now and again
	- coming in for shopping / restaurant
- persistant people
	- office workers
	- people living in apartments
	- office owners

Misc:
- let's get proper alpha channels this time

Scripted Events:
- Function at midnight, set callback time if event is happening
- Callback function runs at gate time

Building Types:
	- Office
	- Restaurant
	- Hotel Room
	- Apartment

lua functions for items to call:
	- payment (money in, money out)
	- find other items on the same floor (noise level)
	- vacate building
